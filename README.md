# Overview

These instructions apply to the management of [Barrel's SpeedTracker instance](http://speed.barrelny.com/). If you'd like to set up your own instance of SpeedTracker view the "Installation" section of the readme at the official SpeedTracker repo [here](https://github.com/speedtracker/speedtracker/).

## Run a Test

Tests are scheduled to run at intervals specified within their profile; however, tests can also be executed manually from the [official SpeedTracker site](https://speedtracker.org/test):

1. Visit [speedtracker.org/test](https://speedtracker.org/test)
1. Enter the following credentials:
    1. Github username (zalerner)
    1. Github repository (speedtracker)
    1. Github branch (master)
    1. Profile ID - The name of the html file in the \_profiles directory that you wish to test (i.e. default, caruso, era, etc.)
    1. Encryption key - Available on 1Pass
1. Click "RUN TEST"
1. Wait for confirmation in the gray box to the right of the credentials
1. Check the [site](http://speed.barrelny.com/) to see your results

## Monitor New Pages

In order to monitor a new page you'll need to clone and edit one of the existing html files in the \_profiles directory. Each profile represents one page of a site being monitored. These html files allow you to configure the following for the page being measured:

1. Human friendly profile name
1. Automated testing interval
1. WebPageTest test settings
1. URL being tested
1. Metrics tracked
1. Budgets for each metric
1. Alerts triggered when budgets are exceeded

Additional information on setting the connectivity and location parameters for WPT can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/a/webpagetest.org/docs/advanced-features/webpagetest-restful-apis#TOC-Specifying-connectivity).

## Develop Locally

While changes to profiles and notification settings can be easily made within GitHub, editing the app's layout, styling, and functionality require bundling the app for production. Should you want to make changes to the app itself, use the following instructions to get the app up and running locally:

1. Install dependencies

  ```
  npm install
  ```
  
1. Start the Jekyll server

  ```
  jekyll serve --watch --port SOME_PORT
  ```
  
1. Start Webpack

  ```
  npm run watch
  ```

1. When you're done with your changes, build the bundle for production

  ```
  npm run build
  ```
