    1. Github username (zalerner)
    1. Github repository (speedtracker)
    1. Github branch (master)
    1. Profile ID - The name of the html file in the \_profiles directory that you wish to test (e.g. caruso)
    1. Encryption key - Available on 1Pass
1. Click "RUN TEST"
1. Wait for confirmation in the gray box to the right of the credentials
1. Check the site to see your results

## Develop Locally

While changes to profiles and notification settings can be easily made within GitHub, editing the app's layout, styling, and functionality require bundling the app for production. Should you want to make changes to the app itself, use the following instructions to get the app up and running locally:

1. Install dependencies

  ```
  npm install
  ```
  
1. Start the Jekyll server

  ```
  jekyll serve --watch --port SOME_PORT
  ```
  
1. Start Webpack

  ```
  npm run watch
  ```

1. When you're done with your changes, build the bundle for production

  ```
  npm run build
  ```
